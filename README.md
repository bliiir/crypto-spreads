## Requirements
* Use two apis
* Store data in MySQL database
* Deploy own api for interacting with the data


## Project plan
1. Get list of assets and prices from Bitfinex and Poloniex
2. Normalize the data to enable cross-exchange comparison
3. Find out what assets Poloniex and Bitfinex have in common
4. Store the timestamped data in a MySQL database
5. Publish API to get cross exchange assets with price in usd, spread in usd and spread in %


## Functionality needed

### Now
* [ ] Get prices
* [ ] Normalize data
* [ ] Store data
* [ ] Get


Own API methods


Get:
Post:

1d average spread
1w average spread
1m average spread



### Later
* [ ] Execute order






## 1. Get asset lists from Bitfinex and Poloniex

| USD markets | GET |
| :-- | :-- |
| Base | https://api.nomics.com/v1/prices?key={insert_key_here} |
| Bitfinex| https://api.nomics.com/v1/exchange-markets/prices?key={insert_key_here}&currency=USD&exchange=bitfinex |
| Poloniex | https://api.nomics.com/v1/exchange-markets/prices?key={insert_key_here}&currency=USDT&exchange=poloniex |


## 2. Normalise the data to enable comparison

## 3. Find out what assets Poloniex and Bitfinex have in common

1. Extract the tickers from the json objects as two lists
2. Use `set()` and `intersection()` to find common elements
3. Create a new list of objects containing the following attributes for the assets that both exchanges have in common sorted by biggest spread:


## 4. Store the timestamped data in a SQL database

## 5. Publish API
